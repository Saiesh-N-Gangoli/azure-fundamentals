Cloud deployment models:
------------------------
1) Public Cloud
2) Private Cloud
3) Hybrid Cloud

Public clouds:
--------------
They are host providers like AWS, azure or google. Public cloud is a type of computing where resources are offered by a third-party provider via the internet and shared by 
organizations and individuals who want to use or purchase them.

Characteristics:
----------------
1) Ownership: The cloud is not owned by any organization but is by any third-party organization like AWS, azure and others. 
2) Multiple End Users: Cloud providers will make avail the resource available to multiple organizations.
3) Public Access: The access is public and the access and be done through an internet connection.
4) Availability: Availability is more.
5) Connectivity: Users and organizations are connected over internet.
6) Skills: You don't need high skills or infrastructures to set up the cloud.

Private Cloud: 
--------------
Within your organizations. Owned and operated by organizations. Organizations create their own cloud envinornment and setup it and also have a data center. When privacy 
is more important for an organization and you need to have everything to secured from the public such as medical firms you need to use private clouds.

Characteristics:
-----------------
1) Ownership: Owner and user both are SAME.
2) Users: Only one organization owning the cloud is the user of the cloud platform.
3) Connectivity: Private network connecetivity.
4) Public access:No public access available.
5) Skills: You need deep technology knowledge.
6) Hardware:Owner is responsible for maintaining hardwares.

Hybrid Clouds:
---------------
Hybrid clouds work by combining the resources and services from two or more separate computing environments. Hybrid cloud architectures require integration, orchestration, 
and coordination so you can share, shift, and synchronize information quickly. Hybrid cloud is the combination of public and private cloud, hosting in public and maintaining 
in secure private cloud.Or the old resources which cannot be upgraded to cloud envinornment but needs to be authorized in some aspect using the cloud. So in that case the 
resources run locally.

Characterisitics:
------------------
1) Resource location: some resources run on public cloud and some run on private cloud.
2) Cost & Efficiency
3) Control: Most management control to organization.
4) Skills: Considerable skills required.
