1) Infrastructure as a Service(IaaS)
-------------------------------------
Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) is a type of cloud computing service that offers essential compute, storage, and networking resources on demand, on a pay-as-you-go basis. 
Migrating your organization's infrastructure to an IaaS solution helps you reduce maintenance of on-premises data centers, save money on hardware costs, and gain real-time 
business insights. IaaS solutions give you the flexibility to scale your IT resources up and down with demand. They also help you quickly provision new applications and 
increase the reliability of your underlying infrastructure. IaaS lets you bypass the cost and complexity of buying and managing physical servers and datacenter infrastructure. Each resource is offered as a separate service component, and you only pay for a particular resource for as long as you need it. A cloud computing service provider like Azure manages the infrastructure, while you purchase, install, configure, and manage your own software—including operating systems, middleware, and applications.

Usage Scenarios:
-----------------
---> Lift and Shift(Migrating workloads): This is the fastest and least expensive method of migrating an application or workload to the cloud. Without refactoring your 
underlying architecture, you can increase the scale and performance, enhance the security, and reduce the costs of running an application or workload.
---> Test and Development: Your team can quickly set up and dismantle test and development environments, bringing new applications to market faster. IaaS makes it quick 
and economical to scale dev/test environments up and down.
---> Storage, backup, and recovery: Your organization avoids the capital outlay for storage and the complexity of storage management, which typically requires a skilled staff
to manage data and meet legal and compliance requirements. IaaS is useful for handling unpredictable demand and steadily growing storage needs. It also can simplify planning 
and management of backup and recovery systems.
---> Web apps: IaaS provides all the infrastructure to support web apps, including storage, web and application servers, and networking resources. Your organization can quickly 
deploy web apps on IaaS and easily scale infrastructure up and down when demand for the apps is unpredictable.
---> High-performance computing: High-performance computing on supercomputers, computer grids, or computer clusters helps solve complex problems involving millions of variables 
or calculations. Examples include protein folding and earthquake simulations, climate and weather predictions, financial modeling, and product design evaluations.

2) Platform as a Service(PaaS) [Serverless Architecture]
--------------------------------------------------------
A developer doesn't know what encryption and backups are. But platform as a service provides the developer the platform to write the best code possible and doesn't want to 
think about the underlying architecture that is required. (Building, testing, platform).Developement is responsible for the organization. OS, Network and other services. 

Platform as a Service can also be defined in such a way that it is just the platform for my service. So the organization can ignore concentrating on the underlying hardwares,
monitoring, patching services, Operating Systems, Anti Viruses and backup solutions.

Use Cases:
----------
---> DBMS: Vendors develops the database for you. Organizations need to create the database which is used by the end user. Platform as a service helps the database to have 
automatic monitoring, backup features.

Example: Azure SQL, Amazon Database System, Google Cloud.

---> Web Application Hosting: Platform as a service will help you in hosting the website with many features like error logging, application monitoring, patching.

Example: Azure Webapps, Elastic Bean Stalk, Google App Engine

---> Container Orchestration: The task of automating and managing a large number of containers and how they interact is known as orchestration. Popular container 
orchestrators include Kubernetes, DC/OS, and Docker Swarm. Azure Container Instances provides some of the basic scheduling capabilities of orchestration platforms.

Example: Azure Container Service, Amazon Elastic Container Service, Google container engine and google kubernetes.

---> Big Data: Azure Data Lake, Amazon Red Shift, Google's Big Table and Big Query.

3) Software as a Service(SaaS): 
-------------------------------
Software as a service (SaaS) allows users to connect to and use cloud-based apps over the Internet. SaaS provides a complete software solution that you purchase on a 
pay-as-you-go basis from a cloud service provider. You rent the use of an app for your organization, and your users connect to it over the Internet, usually with a web 
browser. All of the underlying infrastructure, middleware, app software, and app data are located in the service provider’s data center. The service provider manages the 
hardware and software, and with the appropriate service agreement, will ensure the availability and the security of the app and your data as well. SaaS allows your 
organization to get quickly up and running with an app at minimal upfront cost.


---> Monthly/Yearly Subscription.
---> Buyers own license to the software.
---> Donn't require anything to be installed in my computer
---> Only require browser and license.

Example:
--------
--> Microsoft 365
--> Salesforce
--> Gmail
--> Facebook

SaaS v/s PaaS v/s IaaS v/s Traditional
--------------------------------------
--> Traditional is like think of making a pizza and you need to have both kitchen and pizza items do the pizza. This requires much efforts and time.
--> IaaS is like think of making a pizza and you have your kitchen setup ready and you need to concentrate on making the pizza and not the kitchen.
--> PaaS is like think of ordering a pizza from pizza hut. I need to just worry now on decorating it if I want or heat it if its cold. Minimal effort.
--> SaaS is like ordering an pizza with the best toppings and they are hot as well. You just pay for your pizza and enjoy.

Traditional: Application, data, Runtime, Middleware, O/S, Virtualization, Servers, Storage, Networking.
IaaS: Virtualization, Servers, Storage, Networking are managed by IaaS. (I need to create servers, O/S, server hardening, antivirus, firewall roles)
PaaS: Runtime, Middleware, O/S, Virtualization, Servers, Storage, Networking(Gathered as backend service).(I need to host the data on db that's it)
SaaS: Everything by Cloud.
