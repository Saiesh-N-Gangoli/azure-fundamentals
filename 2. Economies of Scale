Capital Expenditure: Is spending money on physical infrastructures upfront and deducting that from tax bill over time. Its a upfront cost which depreciates 
over time. Big initial investment... Lots of investment is required. 
Operational Expenditure: Is spending money on services or products and bill for now. No upfront cost and pay till you use them. Renting infrastructure.
