Cloud computing: Cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, conveneient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources 
that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.
(Defination given by National Institute of Standards and Technology)

Cloud computing services: [CANS] = [Computer Power, Analytics, Networking, Storage]
--> Computer power: Windows, Linux, web containers.
--> Storage: Files and databases.
--> Networking
--> Analytics
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Benefits:
--> Cost Effective : Pay only for what you use, no need to pay.
--> Scalability: Increase or decrease infrastructure.
    There are two types of scaling:
	a) Horizontal scaling: Adding more and more servers which act as one single unit. (Scale Out)
	b) Vertical Scaling: Adding resoucres to existing servers. Increasing the size of the existing servers like adding CPU and etc...(Scale up)
--> Elasticity
--> Up-to-date
--> Reliable -- Fault Tolerance: Backups, disaster recovery
--> Cloud is global
--> Secure
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Key concepts and terminology:
--> High availability: Ability to run the services for a long run. Short down time. [Availability = Uptime/(Uptime + Downtime)]
--> Scalability: Ability to increase or decrease the resources based on the workload.
--> Elasticity: Ability to dynamically increase or decrease the resources based on the workload.
--> Agility: Ability to react quickly when resources are required.
--> Fault tolerance: Ability to stand strong during component failure. Backups needs to be there.
--> Disaster Recovery: Ability to recover from an event which has taken the cloud down.
--> Global reach: Ability to reach people around the globe though there is no proper infrastructure.
--> Customer Latency Capabilities: Slowness in cloud services === latency problems. Cloud provides to overcome these latency.
--> Predictive Cost Considerations: Ability to predict the cost of cloud services in advance.
--> Technical skill requirement: Less technical skill requirement.
--> Increased productivity: Eliminates many tasks like racking, stacking, patching.
--> Security: Policies, technlogies, controls
